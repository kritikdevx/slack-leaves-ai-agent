            Timestamp of the Message: ${timestamp} (IST)

            **Office Timings:**  
            - **Weekdays (Monday – Friday):** 9:00 AM – 6:00 PM (IST)  
            - **Saturday:** 9:00 AM – 1:00 PM (IST)  
            - **Sunday:** Office is closed  

            **Response Format:** Return a JSON object with the following keys:
            - \`start_time\`: The starting time of the leave or event (ISO string in IST).
            - \`end_time\`: The ending time of the leave or event (ISO string in IST).
            - \`duration\`: A human-readable description of the duration.
            - \`reason\` (optional): The reason provided in the message (if available).
            - \`is_working_from_home\`: \`true\` if the user mentions working from home, otherwise \`false\`.
            - \`is_leave_request\`: \`true\` if the message indicates a leave request, otherwise \`false\`.
            - \`is_running_late\`: \`true\` if the user mentions being late, otherwise \`false\`.

            ---

            ### **Rules for Time Parsing:**
            1. **Handling Out-of-Office Requests:**
              - If the **timestamp is before 9:00 AM or after 6:00 PM on weekdays**, assume the request is for **the next working day**.
              - If the **timestamp is on a Saturday after 1:00 PM**, assume the request is for **Monday** (or the next working day).
              - If the **timestamp is on a Sunday**, assume the request is for **Monday** unless the message explicitly states a different day.

            2. **General Time Interpretation:**
              - Messages referencing **times after 6:00 PM** (on weekdays) should be interpreted as events for the **next working day**.
              - Messages referencing **times before 9:00 AM** (on weekdays) should be interpreted as events for **the same day**.
              - If the message contains only a time (e.g., "11"), assume it refers to **11:00 AM within office hours**.
              - If the user mentions **"running late, will be there by [time]"**:
                - Set the \`start_time\` as **9:00 AM**.
                - Set the \`end_time\` to the mentioned time.
                - Calculate the \`duration\` from **9:00 AM to the mentioned time**.

            3. **Assumptions When Time is Not Specified:**
              - If the user **does not specify a start time**, assume the **current timestamp** as the start time.
              - If the user **does not specify an end time**, assume **6:00 PM on weekdays** or **1:00 PM on Saturday** as the default.
              - If the user **does not specify a duration**, assume it’s a **full-day leave**.

            ---

            ### **Special Handling Cases:**
            - **If the timestamp is on a Sunday**, shift any leave request to Monday by default.
            - **If the user says "running late,"** set \`start_time\` to **9:00 AM**, and \`end_time\` to the specified time.
            - **If the user says "leaving early,"** use the specified time as the \`end_time\`, defaulting to **6:00 PM (weekdays) / 1:00 PM (Saturday)**.
            - **"Working from home" should not be treated as a leave request.**
            - **Assumed Defaults for Common Scenarios**:
              - "Taking day off today" → **Full-day leave from 9:00 AM to 6:00 PM** (or 1:00 PM on Saturday).
              - "OOO for 2 hours" → **Leave for 2 hours from the current timestamp**.
              - "Lunch break 30 mins" → **Leave for 30 minutes from the current timestamp**.
              - "Visiting doctor tomorrow morning" → **Half-day leave tomorrow (9:00 AM – 1:00 PM)**.
              - "WFH this afternoon" → **Not a leave request, \`is_working_from_home = true\`**.
              - "Not feeling well, taking sick leave" → **Full-day sick leave (9:00 AM – 6:00 PM or 1:00 PM on Saturday)**.
              - "Not available in first half" → **Half-day leave (9:00 AM – 1:00 PM)**.
              - "Not available in second half" → **Half-day leave (1:00 PM – 6:00 PM on weekdays only)**.
              - "Running late, will be there by 11:00 AM" → **Late arrival (9:00 AM – 11:00 AM)**.
              - "Leaving early" → **Early leave from the current timestamp to 6:00 PM (or 1:00 PM on Saturday)**.
              - "Leaving early at 5:00 PM today" → **Leave from current time to 5:00 PM**.
              - "Working from home today" → **Not a leave request (\`is_working_from_home = true\`)**.
              - "Leaving early today" → **Leave from current time to 6:00 PM (or 1:00 PM on Saturday)**.
              - "11" → **Assume 11:00 AM as the referenced time within office hours**.
              - "Leaving at 11" → **Leaving at 11:00 AM within office hours**.
              - "Will be there by 11 after a call" → **WFH from 9:00 AM – 11:00 AM, WFO from 11:00 AM onwards**.
